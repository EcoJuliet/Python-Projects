''' LISTS
start_list = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
square_list = []

# Your code here!
for number in start_list:
    square_list.append(number**2)
    square_list.sort()

print square_list
THIS IS A WORKING EXAMPLE THAT:
1 takes the numbers on a start_list
2 makes them **2
3 sorts them in a new list named: "square_list"'''
