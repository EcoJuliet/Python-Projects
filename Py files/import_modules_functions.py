# FUNCTIONS

'''
There are built-in functions, like:
print()
input()
len()

There are also modules (or function libraries), like:
math module
timedate module

These modules have a lot of function inside them.

EXAMPLE:
import random
random.randint(1,10) - > Adds a random interger from 1 to 10.
'''

# IMPORTANT
# Because the randint(x,y) is inside the random module,
#I must add "random." before the function.

# IMPORTING
'''
To import a module, type:
import module

You can import multiple modules by separating them with commas.
Example:
import math, sys, random

ALTERNATIVE:
from module import * -> * means everything.
NOTE: YOU DON'T NEED TO TYPE MODULE. BEFORE THE FUNCTION AFTER DOING THIS.
PODE CAUSAR CONFUSAO, NEM SEMPRE USAR.

You can also import parts of a module by:
from module import part
