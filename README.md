# Python-Projects
This is my Python collection. It'll have all sorts of trash and broken stuff. But they're MINE!


Hi!

I'm a business management student who decided to give a take on some coding. Since Python is the only programming language I'm studying right now, I'll only code on that, for the time being.

Since this is public, I'll explain what you see here:

This repository is something like a "GitBlog" for myself. I'll upload a lot of weird stuff here, just for the sake of having it saved somewhere.

Some might be interesting. Some might be not.

Maybe when I get serious I'll change this.
