This is my PDF merger project. Completely based on Al Sweigart's course "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming" on Udemy.

This project is (for now) composed of two files:
* A .py file that contains the pretty code.
* A .bat file that executes the code in a pretty window.

Version 1: 
* Only receives 3 PDFs files.
* Doesn't allow change in directory.



TODO: - work in progress
Version 2:
* Allow user to input the working directory.
* Allow user to select the amount of PDF files to merge.


NOTE: I don't promiss compatibility on other user's computers.
Changes probably must be made for Enviroment paths and other paths.
