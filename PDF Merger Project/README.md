This is my PDF merger project. Completely based on Al Sweigart's course "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming" on Udemy.

Version 1: 
* Only receives 3 PDFs files.
* Doesn't allow change in directory.



TODO: - work in progress
Version 2:
* Allow user to input the working directory.
* Allow user to select the amount of PDF files to merge.
